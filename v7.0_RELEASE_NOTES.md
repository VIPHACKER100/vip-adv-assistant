# VIP AI Symphony v7.0.0 - Release Notes
## "The Kernel Refactor"

### 🚀 Overview
Version 7.0.0 introduces a major architectural shift from a traditional vanilla JavaScript structure to a modern, modular **ES6+ Module Architecture**. This release focuses on maintainability, performance, and industrial-grade error handling.

### 🏗️ Major Architectural Changes
1.  **ES Module Transition**: 
    -   Converted `app.js` and `functions.js` into ES Modules (`type="module"`).
    -   Implemented a class-based approach for the main application kernel (`VIPApp`).
    -   Introduced `FunctionRegistry` for centralized management of all 75+ AI-driven automation modules.
2.  **Centralized Utility Layer**:
    -   Added `js/utils.js`: A shared library for common operations (ID generation, date formatting, debouncing, etc.).
    -   Added `js/error-handler.js`: An enterprise-grade error management system with context-aware logging and user-facing notifications.
3.  **Kernel Modernization**:
    -   Refactored the boot sequence to use modern asynchronous initialization.
    -   Improved state management and context preservation across modules.
    -   Cleaned up global namespace pollution.

### ✨ Key Features & Improvements
-   **Improved Function Execution**: Functions are now executed through a managed registry with built-in simulation and delay logic.
-   **Enhanced Result UI**: Function results now use a standardized modal template with beautiful glassmorphism styling and auto-formatted data views.
-   **Neural Bootstrapper**: Optimized the application loading sequence with detailed kernel status logging.
-   **Legacy Bridge**: Maintained backward compatibility for non-module components via a specialized window export bridge.

### 🛠️ Technical Details
-   **Core Module**: `js/app.js` (Module, Class `VIPApp`)
-   **Logic Module**: `js/functions.js` (Module, Object `FunctionRegistry`)
-   **Error Shield**: `js/error-handler.js`
-   **Common Utilities**: `js/utils.js`

### 🔧 How to Upgrade
1. Ensure your web server supports ES modules.
2. Update all script references in `index.html` as per the new v7.0 specification.
3. Run `npm install` to ensure all modern development dependencies are available.
