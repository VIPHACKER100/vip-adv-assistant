- **AI Personalities**: User-selectable personas (Concise, Pro, Creative) with distinct response logic.
- **Power Terminal**: Slash command support (`/lock`, `/boost`) for instant agent execution.

### 1. **Intelligence Hub (v2.6)**
- **Dynamic Widgets**: Three real-time dashboard cards displaying System Health (Memory/Storage), Environmental Context (Weather), and Security Protection.
- **Heartbeat Engine**: A background interval logic that ensures the home screen stats feel "alive" with realistic variations.

### 2. **Automation & Workflows (v2.6)**
- **Custom Routine Builder**: A visual interface allowing users to select multiple functions from any of the 13 categories and chain them into a single-tap automation.
- **Visual Picker**: User-friendly checkbox system to browse and add actions (75+ options) to personalized workflows.

### 3. **AI Smart Hub (v2.5)**
- **Conversational Interface**: Persistent sliding chat drawer with tool-calling capabilities.
- **Action Chips**: Horizontal scrolling suggestion pills for instant device status reports and common commands.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Refactored modular backend supporting GPT-powered intent mapping.

### 4. **Hardware & Power Tools (v2.5)**
