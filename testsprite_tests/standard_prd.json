  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User launches the app and the core application logic initializes UI and real-time context monitoring (battery, network, time).",
    "User views categorized function cards and selects a function to execute, generating realistic simulated data shown in a modal.",
    "User triggers voice access by clicking the microphone icon, speaks commands, which are recognized, processed, and provide audio/text feedback.",
    "User uses keyboard shortcuts to open search, automation builder, settings, or execute quick actions, with option to view all shortcuts.",
    "User searches functions via fuzzy search, navigates results with keyboard or mouse, and executes chosen functions.",
    "User bookmarks favorite functions for quick access and manages favorites via header modal.",
    "User customizes theme between Dark, Light, or Auto modes through settings or keyboard shortcut.",
    "User builds automation workflows by drag-and-drop in the automation builder, configures triggers and actions, and runs the workflow.",
    "User exports current app state (automations, favorites, settings) to JSON backup and can import backups from file with validation.",
    "User monitors usage analytics and performance metrics from the performance dashboard.",
    "User installs the app as a PWA for offline use and native-like experience.",
    "User accesses recent functions history from header button or keyboard shortcut, re-executes or clears history.",
    "User edits keyboard shortcuts via the shortcut editor modal, personalizing key bindings with conflict prevention and live updates."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All 75+ functions execute with high-fidelity simulated data and native glyph rendering.",
    "Always-Listening mode maintains connectivity across sessions and auto-restarts upon interruption.",
    "Command Center normalized all inputs correctly to corresponding function handlers.",
    "Deep Telemetry charts render smoothly at 100ms intervals with accurate Performance API data.",
    "Autonomous triggers fire consistently when battery/charging thresholds are breached.",
    "AI Smart Hub maintains context across 10 turns and displays Neural Visualizer pulses.",
    "Omni-Search and Command Palette provide instant, fuzzy-matched results with keyboard focus.",
    "Platform-aware logic correctly redirects hardware calls based on UA/Feature detection.",
    "PWA versioning forces cache refresh of visual assets upon update (v5.0.0).",
    "Application remains responsive across all major desktop and mobile browser kernels."
