  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User launches the web app through a modern browser, which initializes with core logic loading UI components and real device APIs for battery and network status.",
    "User browses through the rich catalog of 65+ functions organized in 12 categories and clicks a function card to execute it, viewing dynamic simulation results in a modal dialog.",
    "User operates the assistant via voice commands by clicking the microphone icon and speaking supported commands for hands-free control, receiving text-to-speech feedback and error handling messages.",
    "User employs keyboard shortcuts to quickly access search, toggle voice or theme, open automation builder, or close modals, customizing these shortcuts in settings if desired.",
    "User uses the fuzzy search modal to quickly find functions by keyword, navigate results via keyboard, and execute functions without scrolling.",
    "User bookmarks frequently used functions via the favorites system; these favorites are readily accessible from a dedicated header button and persist across sessions.",
    "User creates and manages automation workflows using the visual automation builder, chaining triggers and actions.",
    "User backs up their favorites, automations, and settings to a JSON file and restores them through the import feature.",
    "User monitors their usage and application performance data in a dedicated analytics dashboard accessed from settings.",
    "User benefits from offline capabilities by installing the app as a PWA, enabling seamless usage without an internet connection."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All 65+ functions execute correctly with realistic, varied simulated data each time.",
    "Voice access system accurately recognizes and processes 30+ predefined commands, including error handling for permission denial.",
    "Keyboard shortcuts perform their assigned actions globally and update instantly if customized by the user.",
    "Search modal returns correct fuzzy matches instantly and supports keyboard navigation and execution.",
    "Favorites are saved persistently in localStorage and reflected accurately in the UI favorites modal and indicators.",
    "Theme selection persists across sessions and can switch between Dark, Light, and Auto modes smoothly.",
    "Exported backup JSON files contain complete and valid data, and import restores the data correctly after validation.",
    "Performance monitor tracks and displays up-to-date analytics without impacting app responsiveness.",
    "Recent functions history accurately maintains the last 10 executed functions with usage counts and time indicators, and supports quick re-execution and clear history functionality.",
    "PWA offline support caches necessary files, allows app installation, and enables full app functionality without internet connectivity.",
    "Custom shortcut editor prevents conflicting bindings, allows resetting to defaults, and applies changes immediately.",
    "No critical errors or console warnings occur during normal operation across supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)."
